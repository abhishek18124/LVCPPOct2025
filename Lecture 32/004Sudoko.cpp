Sudoku

Given a partially filled 'n x n' grid, the goal is to assign digits from 1 to 9 to the empty cells
so that every row, column, and subgrid of size '√n x √n'  contains exactly one instance of
the digits from 1 to 9.

Assume 'n' is a perfect square, hence there are 'n' subgrids of size '√n x √n' each.
